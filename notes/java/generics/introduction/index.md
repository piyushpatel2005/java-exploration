# Introduction to Java Generics

Java Generics allow you to use parameterized types. Parameterized types are classes that can operate on a type 
parameter. The type parameter is a placeholder for a type (like `String`, `Integer`, etc.) that will be specified 
when the class is instantiated. Java has several built-in generic classes and interfaces in the `java.util` package. 
For example, `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` are generic classes that can store any type of object.

## Benefits of Java Generics

- **Type Safety**: Generics make your code type-safe. It helps you catch type mismatches at compile time rather than 
  runtime. In earlier versions of Java, you had to cast the object to the correct type, which could lead to runtime 
  exceptions. For example, if you have a `List` of `String` objects, you can't add an `Integer` object to it. The 
  compiler will catch this error at compile time.
- **Code Reusability**: Generics allow you to write a single class or method that can work with different types of 
  data.
